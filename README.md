# Pathfinding

This project demonstrates 4 different pathfinding algorithms on a 10 by 10 grid - A Star, Djikstra's, Best first, and Breadth first. This project was built using C#.

### Instructions

Nodes can be set to an impassable wall by clicking once, "high cost" nodes can be placed by double clicking a node. The start and end nodes (shown in green and red, respectuflly) can be moved using the corresponding buttons. Once the grid has been set up, an algorithm can be run by clicking one of the buttons on the right. The program will then highlight the nodes which are part of the search space in light blue, before the final path is highlighted in dark blue. The path can be cleared and the entire grid can be reset using dedicated buttons, and a toggle is included to enable diagonal movement.
